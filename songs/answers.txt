If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
The listener has a high danceability index, with an average of above 0.6 for most songs
(indicating an enjoyment of danceable songs). The energy index ranges between values of
approximately 0.4 to 0.7 (indicating an enjoyment of songs with a moderate energy level).
Finally, the valence index remains low, mostly not exceeding 0.4 (indicating a preference
for songs with low valence).

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
The way I have determined these conclusions may not accurately represent the listener's
preferences because I have relied solely on my own interpretation of the table.
To make it more precise, I would suggest taking an average of each representative index
(by summing all the results and dividing by 100). This way, we would obtain a more accurate
 proportion for each of the 3 aspects.
