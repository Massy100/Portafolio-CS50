        <h2>Benefits of playing chest</h2>
        <p>“Benjamin Franklin wrote in 1779 that the game of chess “is not merely an idle amusement (since) life
            is a kind of chess, in which we have often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend
            with, and in which there is a vast variety of good and evil events that are in some degree the effects
            of prudence or the want of it.” Franklin suggests that playing chess develops foresight, circumspection,
            perseverance, and sportsmanship.</p>
        <p>Today, educators and parents have discovered that chess is a wonderful way to teach young children
            mathematical concepts and important thinking skills that they can use their entire life. Chess
            also has connections to standards in the fields of language arts (reading, writing, oral
            presentation), social studies (geography - longitude and latitude, mapping), and science
            (graphing and critical thinking skills). Here are some other benefits of learning chess:</p>
        <p>* Improves cognitive skills (including concentration, pattern recognition, decision making, algebraic
            and geometric thinking, problem-solving, spatial reasoning, and critical thinking)</p>
        <p>* Improves self-confidence and self-worth</p>
        <p>* Increases attention span</p>
        <p>* Increases memory capacity</p>
        <p>* Encourages understanding of choice and consequences for problem- solving…helps students realize that
            they are responsible for their actions and must accept the consequences of those actions</p>
        <p>* Offers a logical pattern and critical-thinking system</p>
